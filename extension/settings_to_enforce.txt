Be wary of relying on a blocking system call in ruby -- firefox-bin will sometimes daemonize, like when it prints an "updated extension" message.

Disable ALL updates. Firefox starts up with unexpected behavior (multiple tabs, temp start pages etc.)

NEVER save tabs when quitting

If possible, limit the number of tabs to 1

ALWAYS disable cache

How to handle pop-ups?

On quiting, firefox asks if you'd like to save your tabs (force quit in the plugin?)

Make homepage default to about:blank (?)

Crash recovery
browser.sessionstore.enabled = false
browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash = false

Disable password save nag:
signon.rememberSignons = false

Disable Crash Reporter
You can disable the Mozilla Crash Reporter by opening the "application.ini" file in the installation directory, finding the entry [Crash Reporter] Enabled=1 and changing the 1 to 0 (you will need to repeat the edit if an application update replaces the file).

"Firefox is already running, but is not responding"
You can not disable this dialog, but you can avoid it by using different profiles and use the "-fxProfile" switch with iimInit.



REPLACE ALERTS?

Overwrite window.alert, window.confirm, window.prompt in contentWindow with a function that just returns true or false
