Disable ALL updates. Firefox starts up with unexpected behavior (multiple tabs, temp start pages etc.)

NEVER save tabs when quitting

If possible, limit the number of tabs to 1

ALWAYS disable cache

How to handle pop-ups?

On quiting, firefox asks if you'd like to save your tabs (force quit in the plugin?)

Make homepage default to about:blank (?)
